# Spatial Intelligence Architecture for Physical AI: Generation, Understanding, and Reasoning of Spatial Information

## Motivation

**Advancing Physical AI with Spatial Intelligence**

Physical AI has made remarkable progress in achieving human-like movement and basic tasks. As Physical AI advances toward solving complex problems in real-world environments, a critical capability becomes essential: **understanding space**.

**The Challenge of Complex Real-World Environments**

In complex, dynamic environments, robots must:

- **See the space**: High-fidelity 3D reconstruction of realistic environments
- **Understand the context**: Semantic comprehension of objects, people, and spatial relationships
- **Decide what to do and how**: Autonomous reasoning and action planning based on spatial understanding

**Our Approach: Three-Stage Architecture**

We propose a framework combining Generation, Understanding, and Reasoning to enable Physical AI in both training (simulation) and deployment (real-world).

**Impact on Physical AI**

- **Training Phase (Sim)**: Generation → Realistic environments → Safe, scalable learning
- **Deployment Phase (Real)**: Understanding + Reasoning → Autonomous operation

> **"If Physical AI focuses on 'moving like humans', Spatial AI focuses on 'seeing, thinking, and deciding like humans'"**
